# The Trust Door

The Trust Door was a year-long project created during the Project Lead the Way (PLTW) Engineering Design & Development Class. Worked in a team of 4 to produce a garage door add-on that automatically operated a garage door.
As a part of the project, an app was created that could communicate with the product and operate the garage door.

## App Features:
* UI that displays the state of a garage door
* Operates a garage door using a customizable geofence
* Customizable geofence location & size

## App UI:
* Default screen displays state of garage door, last opened/closed time, and 'settings' button

* Settings UI allows user to set customized geofence location & size
